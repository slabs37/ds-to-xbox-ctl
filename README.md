# DualShock to Xbox Controller
A python script using PYXInput and Pygame to create and control a virtual Xbox controller with a DualShock controller.

For games that only support Xbox controllers.

# Usage
- Install PYXInput and ScpVBus using the instructions available at [the PYXInput repository](https://github.com/bayangan1991/PYXInput)
- Run the script

# Problems
Dpad actions aren't being sent.
This problem is caused by the lack of documentation at PYXInput, and the methods to send dpad controls weren't found, and weren't implemented in this script.
